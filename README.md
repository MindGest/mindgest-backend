## About the Project

Currently, the Center for Provision of Services to the Community, of the Faculty
of Psychology and Educational Sciences at the University of Coimbra,
CPSC-FPCE-UC, makes use of a old-fashioned, complex service management platform
that does not respond to its users needs.

This project, carried out within the scope of the Project Management (2022/2023)
course, attempts to develop a prototype of a management platform (MindGest) that
addresses the existing problems. With this new platform, we attempt to automate
time-consuming and complex tasks that are currently carried out manually, and
improve on the current platform functionalities, making them simple and more 
user friendly.

## Development

### Project Structure

* `api`: The source code of the API
* `docs`: Miscellaneous resources/artifacts generated during the development of the backend.
  + `assets`: Logos (Miscellaneous)
  + `db`: Database diagrams and documentation
  + `team`: Backend team *planning poker* estimations
* `util`: Utilities + Tools for backend deployment (docker)
